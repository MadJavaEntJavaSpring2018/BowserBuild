# Problem Statements
Most build tools aren't very intuitive and for a student new to Java, it can make the learning curve much steeper. Newcomers to Java discover there is almost as much to learn about the tools as there is to learn about Java itself. Lastly, these tools aren't very graphical making it harder for the modern learner to adjust<br><br>
This goal of this project is to created an interactive web application in which a user enters the components that they will need for their project and then returns a tarball in which they can implement in the command line.

## Possibile Technology Brainstrom
1. Bash Scripting
2. ANT? Do we deliver a build.xml file?
3. Maven Archetypes mvn command or pom.xml
4. File Transfer
5. Do we want to store build templates?<br>
	If yes:
* 	Would we store these for the user 
* 	Will we store these in a repository that users can choose from?


### Knowledge Base
1. Classpath
2. .jar's
3. dependencies
4. Java Servlet
5. Form Based Authenitcation?
